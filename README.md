# Co-MTP: A Cooperative Trajectory Prediction Framework with Multi-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving
![The overall architecture of Co-MTP.](static/images/overview.jpg)

## Introduction
Co-MTP is a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset [V2X-Seq](https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq), and the results show that Co-MTP achieves **SOTA** performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.
